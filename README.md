Mod description
===============
StepUpNext helps you to climb blocks without needing to jump, or autojump. While it's similar to enabling autojump, it doesn't come with the hunger penalty that jumping has.

 

It allows you to switch between "normal mode" and "autojump mode" which are what the client normally does, and "big steps mode" which allows you to climb full blocks without jumping. Modes can be switched using the J key at any time; the key can be changed in options as usual.

 

The mod is client side and should work with vanilla servers as well, except if the server has some code to prevent the mod from working. Because of this, the mod saves its configuration per server, so you can turn it on wherever it works without hampering servers where it doesn't.

 

This is a continuation of https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stepup, which didn't get updated for a long time, and for which the author isn't planning to do a Fabric version.
